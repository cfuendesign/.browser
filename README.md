A little VCS action for my universal Browser configuration because
- üóëÔ∏è Some browsers like to scrap my configuration from time to time out of nowhere
- üíï I love creating personal configuration standards
- üì¶ Getting my stuff straight is one of my top priorities

### Keybinds

Some of these are universal, but when not, they're tagged along with the name of the browser they're specified for.

Mostly based on [Vimiun's](https://github.com/bitcode/Vimium/blob/master/keybinds.md) and [Firefox's](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly?redirectslug=Keyboard+shortcuts&redirectlocale=en-US) keybinds.

When a 'Used' keybind is specified, it usually means that the action is unbinded (It either is left empty or provides a common Window Manager keybind), but if the user wants to bind that action, the 'Preferred' keybind should be used.

<!--TODO: [TOC]-->

**Quit Browser**

Alt is inspired by Firefox's quit shortcut, which isn't a default (Therefore leaving the action unbinded, given that Alt + F4 is the universal "Close window" keybind) because, for me, quitting the browser is not a speed critical operation.

Used: `Alt + F4` (Leave blank)
Preferred: `Alt + F4` (Leave blank)
Alt: `Ctrl + q`

**Add Tab**

The alt (ctrl+t) is a fairly common shortcut, so I leave the alt as a default in case an acquaintance or loved one needs to use my browser.

Preferred: `Shift + o`
Alt:`Ctrl + t`

**Add Private Tab**

Preferred: `Shift + < + o`
Alt: `Ctrl + t + p`

**Duplicate Tab**

Preferred is inspired by Vim's (y)ank and (p)aste keybinds. Alt inspired by Min's duplicate tab keybind.

Preferred: `Shift + y + p`
Alt: `Ctrl + d`

**Add Task (Min)**

There are two reasons there is no default "Add Task" keybind: First, task management is not a speed critical operation for me. And second, when I do manage my tasks, I just use the GUI. This is due to the fact that there are no bindable task actions aside from task creation and navigation and given that managing tasks is a simple chore that I like to take my time with, since I usually just arrange my tasks to avoid stressing out, for the sake of organizing myself better or just to make sure I'm taking work as easy as possible.

Used: ` ` (Leave blank)
Preferred: `[ + o`
Alt: `Ctrl + n`

**Toggle Tasks (Min)**

Preferred: `√± + {`
Alt: ` ` <!--TODO-->

**Go Back**

Preferred: `Ctrl + h`
Alt: ` ` <!--TODO-->


**Go Forward**

Preferred: `Ctrl + l`
Alt: ` ` <!--TODO-->

**Run Shortcut/Bang (Min)**

I currently don't really use bangs, so I don't find this very useful. They are an advantage that I will, well, take advantage of, but later. So I'm still giving it a preferred keybind that I will test later.

Used: ` ` (Leave empty)
Preferred: `!`
Alt: `Ctrl + e`

**Complete Searchbar (Min)**

I have no idea how this is supposed to work, I tried it but doesn't do anything. Leaving it out til I understand it.

Used: ` ` (Leave empty)
Preferred: ` ` (Leave empty)
Alt: `Ctrl + Enter`

**Close Tab**

Preferred: `x`
Alt: `Ctrl + w`

**Restore Tab**

Preferred: `Shift + x`
Alt: `Ctrl + Shift + T`

**Goto First Tab**

Never used it and I have yet to find a reason why switching from the first to the last tab with such speed would be important unless you have terrible tab management. Besides, a good Vim-Inspired keybind that suits my needs in this version requires a tad of thinking I'm not willing to do right now.

Used: ` ` (Leave empty)
Preferred: ` ` (Leave empty)
Alt: `Shift + Ctrl + 9`

**Goto Last Tab**

Never used it and I have yet to find a reason why switching from the first to the last tab with such speed would be important unless you have terrible tab management. Besides, a good Vim-Inspired keybind that suits my needs in this version requires a tad of thinking I'm not willing to do right now.

Used: ` ` (Leave empty)
Preferred: ` ` (Leave empty)
Alt: `Ctrl + 9`
